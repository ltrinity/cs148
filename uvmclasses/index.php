    <h1>Populating your tables with CSV data.</h1>
    <p>You must run the menu option in the following order. I have kept them separate so they run faster.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Populate the Courses</li>
                <li>Populate the Teachers</li>
                <li>Populate the Sections (ie you need the above foreign keys)</li>
            </ol>
    <p>You can look at tables at any time.</p>
